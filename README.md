### Hi! I'm Chris Wiegman

I am a developer, educator, blogger and open-source contributor dedicated to creating human-centered, privacy-focused technology. Over the past two decades, I have built everything from WordPress plugins (including iThemes Security) to Chrome extensions, development environments and developer tools. A teacher at heart, I have lectured in aviation and computer science, mentored emerging technologists, and spoken at conferences worldwide. A former pilot turned software engineer, I remain passionate about building ethical, sustainable tools for real people.
